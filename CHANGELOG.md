# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking changes

- **Route parameters now support strings only.** The `int()` and `uuid()`
  factories, `SpaRouteParameterType`, `SpaRouteParameter.type`, and
  `SpaRouteParameter.hasValidValue()` were removed. Generated Kotlin route
  builders take `String` and generated TypeScript builders take `string`
  for every parameter. Optional parameters remain supported.

  The runtime still rejects missing required parameters and unknown parameter
  names, but no longer validates integer or UUID formats. Any value-format
  validation belongs in application code.

  Migration: replace `int("id")` and `uuid("id")` with `string("id")` and
  update the imports. For direct construction, use `SpaRouteParameter("id")`
  without a type argument.
  Regenerate client and server routes, then pass string values to route builders
  (for example, `UserDetail(id = "123")` in Kotlin or
  `UserDetail({ id: "123" })` in TypeScript). Explicit parameter metadata is
  still required.

## 0.3.0 (2026-07-18)

### Breaking changes

- **The core contract package `com.caseymcguiredotcom.sparoutecontract` was
  renamed to `com.sparouting.contract`** (its `codegen` subpackage moved with
  it). Two defaults changed along with it:

  - The default generated server routes package is now
    `com.sparouting.generated.spa.routes` (was
    `com.caseymcguiredotcom.generated.spa.routes`).
  - The plugin's default route-definitions source directory is now
    `src/main/kotlin/com/sparouting/contract/applications` (was
    `src/main/kotlin/com/caseymcguiredotcom/sparoutecontract/applications`).

  Migration: update imports of contract types (`SpaApplicationDefinition`,
  `SpaRouteKey`, `route`, `int`, ...) to `com.sparouting.contract`, move your
  route definition files to the new default directory (or set
  `routeDefinitions.sourceDirectory` explicitly), and regenerate server routes.
  Maven coordinates (`io.github.caseymcguire:*`) are unchanged.

## 0.2.0 (2026-07-16)

### Breaking changes

- **SPA route rules now evaluate in two stages with different fallthrough
  defaults.** Previously, application-wide rules and route-level rules were
  concatenated into a single chain that was allow-by-default: if every rule
  returned `Skip` — or no rules were configured — the route was served.

  Now:

  - Application-wide rules (`SinglePageApplicationConfig.rules`) are a
    **gate, deny-by-default**: the first `Allow` passes the request on to the
    route-level rules, the first `Deny` denies it, and if every rule skips —
    including when the SPA has no rules at all — the request is answered
    with `404`.
  - Route-level rules (`SinglePageApplicationConfig.routeRules`) are
    **vetoes, allow-by-default**: the first `Deny` denies the request, the
    first `Allow` serves it, and if every rule skips the route is served.
  - An application-level `Allow` passes the gate but no longer short-circuits
    route-level rules — those always run once the gate passes.

  Migration:

  - An SPA with no `rules` configured now answers `404` on every route. Add
    `rules = listOf(AllowAll())` (new builtin, see below) to keep serving it.
  - Gate rules that returned `Skip` on success (e.g. a `RequireLogin` that
    denies anonymous users and otherwise skips) should return `Allow` on
    success, or be followed by `AllowAll()` in the chain.
  - `SpaRouteResponseEvaluator.evaluate(rules, request)` is now
    `evaluate(applicationRules, routeRules, request)`. Callers that
    concatenated the two chains themselves must pass them separately.

  The route decision endpoint (`/__spa/route-decision`) and the generated
  client `canNavigate` guard reflect the same verdicts automatically.

- **`generateWebpackBundleEntries` was replaced by the bundler-neutral
  `generateBundleEntries` task.** The `webpackBundleEntries { ... }`
  configuration block and the `webpackBundleEntriesOutputFile` extension
  property were likewise renamed to `bundleEntries { ... }` and
  `bundleEntriesOutputFile`. The generated file's contents are unchanged
  (only its regeneration-command comment differs), so migration is a rename
  in `build.gradle.kts` and in any scripts or CI steps invoking the task.

### Added

- Built-in rules in `io.github.caseymcguire.sparouting.spring.rules.builtin`:
  - `AllowAll` — allows every route; the explicit opt-in for an ungated SPA.
  - `AllowPublic(vararg routes: SpaRouteKey)` — allows the listed routes for
    everyone; place it ahead of an application-wide gate to exempt public
    routes while everything else stays gated.
  - `DenyAll(action)` — denies every route (404 by default); an
    application-wide kill switch or a route-level veto for routes taken out
    of service.
- `generateBundleEntries` Gradle task and `bundleEntries { outputFile = ... }`
  configuration. The generated bundle-name-to-app-root-path map is
  bundler-neutral: webpack consumes it as `entry`, Vite as
  `build.rollupOptions.input` (see `docs/spring-boot-client-apps.md` for the
  Vite setup).
