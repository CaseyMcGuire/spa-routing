# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (2026-07-16)

### Breaking changes

- **SPA route rules now evaluate in two stages with different fallthrough
  defaults.** Previously, application-wide rules and route-level rules were
  concatenated into a single chain that was allow-by-default: if every rule
  returned `Skip` — or no rules were configured — the route was served.

  Now:

  - Application-wide rules (`SinglePageApplicationConfig.rules`) are a
    **gate, deny-by-default**: the first `Allow` passes the request on to the
    route-level rules, the first `Deny` denies it, and if every rule skips —
    including when the SPA has no rules at all — the request is answered
    with `404`.
  - Route-level rules (`SinglePageApplicationConfig.routeRules`) are
    **vetoes, allow-by-default**: the first `Deny` denies the request, the
    first `Allow` serves it, and if every rule skips the route is served.
  - An application-level `Allow` passes the gate but no longer short-circuits
    route-level rules — those always run once the gate passes.

  Migration:

  - An SPA with no `rules` configured now answers `404` on every route. Add
    `rules = listOf(AllowAll())` (new builtin, see below) to keep serving it.
  - Gate rules that returned `Skip` on success (e.g. a `RequireLogin` that
    denies anonymous users and otherwise skips) should return `Allow` on
    success, or be followed by `AllowAll()` in the chain.
  - `SpaRouteResponseEvaluator.evaluate(rules, request)` is now
    `evaluate(applicationRules, routeRules, request)`. Callers that
    concatenated the two chains themselves must pass them separately.

  The route decision endpoint (`/__spa/route-decision`) and the generated
  client `canNavigate` guard reflect the same verdicts automatically.

- **`generateWebpackBundleEntries` was replaced by the bundler-neutral
  `generateBundleEntries` task.** The `webpackBundleEntries { ... }`
  configuration block and the `webpackBundleEntriesOutputFile` extension
  property were likewise renamed to `bundleEntries { ... }` and
  `bundleEntriesOutputFile`. The generated file's contents are unchanged
  (only its regeneration-command comment differs), so migration is a rename
  in `build.gradle.kts` and in any scripts or CI steps invoking the task.

### Added

- Built-in rules in `io.github.caseymcguire.sparouting.spring.rules.builtin`:
  - `AllowAll` — allows every route; the explicit opt-in for an ungated SPA.
  - `AllowPublic(vararg routes: SpaRouteKey)` — allows the listed routes for
    everyone; place it ahead of an application-wide gate to exempt public
    routes while everything else stays gated.
  - `DenyAll(action)` — denies every route (404 by default); an
    application-wide kill switch or a route-level veto for routes taken out
    of service.
- `generateBundleEntries` Gradle task and `bundleEntries { outputFile = ... }`
  configuration. The generated bundle-name-to-app-root-path map is
  bundler-neutral: webpack consumes it as `entry`, Vite as
  `build.rollupOptions.input` (see `docs/spring-boot-client-apps.md` for the
  Vite setup).
